## Description
DGApy is a python package that implements tools for the Matsubara Green's function formalism of correlated electrons on a 
lattice. Based on the implemented frameworks, the dynamical vertex approximation (DGA) for the Hubbard model, a Feynman 
diagrammatic 
extension of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), can be calculated.

DGApy supports:

- All primitive lattices
- General tight-binding models
- DGA calculations for the Hubbard model
- Solving the linearized Eliashberg equation to obtain superconducting eigenvalues
- Calculation of the optical conductivity, including ladder-like vertex corrections
- Analytic continuation of Matsubara Green's functions and physical susceptibilities to the real axis

A detailed description of the underlying theory and applications to nickelate and cuprate superconductors can be found in my 
 [PhD thesis](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/176739).

## Publications using DGApy

DGApy has already been successfully used in several scientific publications:

- S. Di Cataldo, **P. Worm** <em> et al.</em>; arXiv preprint 
  - [Unconventional superconductivity without doping: infinite-layer nickelates under 
    pressure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06195)
- **P. Worm** <em> et al.</em>; arXiv preprint
  - [Spin fluctuations sufficient to mediate superconductivity in nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08260)

## Installation
Run the script
```
. install.sh
```
in the root directory. This provides the python package dga and several command line interfaces. A detailed description of them 
is provided below.

## Usage

### Python package

To use the dga python package, import it via

```
import dga.<submodule name>
```

The package is split into several modules. Here we list the most common ones: 

- matsubara_frequencies (mf): handle Matsubara frequencies and frequency transformations
- brillouin_zone (bz): handle the Brillouin zone, mapping into the irreducible BZ and mapping to k-paths
- wannier: handle the tight-binding Hamiltonian and fourier transformation from real to reciprocal space
- two_point (twop): classes for the one-particle Green's function and self-energy
- local_four_point (lfp): handle local (impurity) four-poin functions
- four_point (fp): handle non-local (ladder) four-point functions
- analytic_continuation (ac): perform the numeric analytic continuation 
  - based on the [ana_cont](https://github.com/josefkaufmann/ana_cont) package 
- eliashberg_equation (eq): power iteration eigenvalue solver for the linearized Eliashberg equation
- optics: calculate the optical conductivity

It is recommended to complete the tutorial, contained in the "tutorial" folder, to get a first impression on how the modules 
can be used.


### Command line interfaces

With this python package also a command line interface (cli) is provided. Contrary to the different modules, which are 
intended to be used as a toolbox, the cli implements the dynamical vertex approximation for the Hubbard model. 

### dga_dc

Create the default config file for dga_main in the current folder.

### dga_main

To run a dga calculation perform the following steps:

- Prepare a config file
- Prepare the DMFT input files
- Run the dga_main cli

For the DMFT input file structure currently two input formats are supported. 

#### type: "w2dyn"
Either the output of the [w2dynamics](https://github.com/w2dynamics/w2dynamics) code.

- '1p-data.hdf5': converged dmft solution
- 'g4iw_sym.hdf5': measurement of the two-particle Green's function for the same anderson impurity model as obtained from the 
  DMFT cycle; it is advised to use the same chemical potential (mu) as in the '1p-data.hdf5' file and not perform a new mu 
  search. 

#### type: "default"

If you are not using [w2dynamics](https://github.com/w2dynamics/w2dynamics) and you do not want to implement a parser to your impurity solver a generic input format is 
also supported, which uses a single numpy file:

- fname_1p: 'dmft_input.npy': numpy dictionary with the following entries:
  - 'giw': one-particle Green's function
  - 'siw': self-energy
  - 'n': occupation
  - 'mu_dmft': chemical potential
  - 'beta': inverse temperature
  - 'u': on-site Hubbard interaction
  - 'g4iw_dens': density-channel (upup + updown) two-particle Green's function; (w,v,vp) layout
  - 'g4iw_magn': magnetic-channel (upup - updown) two-particle Green's function; (w,v,vp) layout

### dga_test

Run the test suite in the terminal. This will run the unit tests and linting.

## Testing: 

#### Unit testing

To run the unit tests, run 

```
. dga_test.sh 
```

in the root directory. This will run unit tests and linting which are also included in the gitlab CI.

#### End-to-end testing 
Several tests use datasets generated with [w2dynamics](https://github.com/w2dynamics/w2dynamics). They input files are 
contained in the default input structure in the "tests" folder.
